Project Description [5 pts]: I am replicating Terraria (basically 2D Minecraft).
As of right now, you are only able to move. I will soon add terrain generation.
Hopefully I can add features such as building, mining, AI, etc.

Structural Plan [5 pts]: 
    • Player and Block class
    • the usual controller and draw functions
    • a perlin class to generate noise
    ª possibly voronoi

Algorithmic Plan [5 pts]: 
    • Collision Detection by checking the edges of each entity.
    • Terrain Generation with perlin noise generation.
    • And maybe voronoi for biome generation.

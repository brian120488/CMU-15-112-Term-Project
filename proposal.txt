Project Description [5 pts]: I am replicating Terraria (basically 2D Minecraft).
As of right now, you are only able to move. I will soon add terrain generation.
Hopefully I can add features such as building, mining, AI, etc. 

Structural Plan [5 pts]: 
    • Player and Block class
    • The usual controller and draw functions
    • Perlin class to generate noise
    • Possibly voronoi for biomes

Algorithmic Plan [5 pts]: 
    • Collision Detection by checking the edges of each entity.
    • Terrain Generation with perlin noise generation.
    • And maybe voronoi for biome generation.

TP2 Update:
If the terrain in front of you is new (not discovered), you will be able to see 
the generating blocks.

World is infinite compared to Terraria because procedural generation instead of 
preset generation; however, cannot generate to the left.

Added other blocks. Able to mine but not place just yet.

TP3 Update:
Placing Blocks!

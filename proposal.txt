Project Description [5 pts]: I am replicating Terraria (basically 2D Minecraft).
Hopefully I can add features such as building, mining, AI, etc.

Structural Plan [5 pts]: Player and Block class, the usual controller and draw functions, possiblly a perlin class to generate noise,

Algorithmic Plan [5 pts]: Collision Detection and Terrain Generation (with perlin noise for terrain generation and maybe voronoi for biomes)

Version Control Plan [5 pts]: Github: https://github.com/brian120488/Term-Project
